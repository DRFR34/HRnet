HRnet is the fourteenth project of the OpenClassrooms training “Javascript Application Developer - React”.
This project is focused on converting the existing HRnet application from jQuery to React.
It involves refactoring key pages, optimizing performance, and documenting the technical process. The goal is to reduce technical debt and improve the overall performance of the web application.
